Hi. My name is John Villaflor and I am from Quezon City in the Philippines and this is my project. In this project I built an app that can encode and decode your file to make it secure. It uses AES which is actually the encryption standard being widely used today.

Here, we have the ENCODE and DECODE buttons where it prompts an error because we need to choose a file first which we havent' done yet. To do that, we click FILE then a new window will appear where we can choose anywhere in our PC what FILE we want to encode.

In KEY, it is not needed when encoding since it wil be randomly generated during process. Once we are done choosing, just click the ENCODE button and a message will appear if succesful. Just click OK.

It will generate the encrypted file on the same directory of the chosen file along the KEY with it which we will need later on when decrypting.

If we want to decode the file, we just need to choose the encrypted file and the KEY that was generated along it when it was encrypted. Once done choosing, just click DECODE and a message will appear if done and if the decoding is VALID. VALID means the file is properly decoded with the right KEY.

For example, if we choose a different file or a key, it will prompt that the message is INVALID which means the file in not decoded because of the wrong file, wrong key, or a combination of BOTH. 

The project is also made available to be an executable file which can be run by just opening it. This is my project and this was CS50.
